# COMPREHENSIVE EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS FOR MONITORING MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS

Objective:
To identify the emotional states of students by monitoring facial expressions in high recognition at a 
high frame rate , thereby assisting teachers in helping students with their mental health problems

Abstract
Much of the discriminative information that we require to tell apart facial expressions that 
distinguish different emotional states of a person lies mostly in very subtle movements around the 
eye. So, if in a real-time monitoring scenario we are able to accurately map these movements to 
underlying emotional states of a person, we could monitor his/her mental health.
Our proposal conducts a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of facial geometries identified in 
images captured by a high-resolution camera and increased frame-rate to map subtle changes in 
facial expressions which could be as minute as a small muscle movement to underlying genuine felt 
emotions. Implementing this proposal in a classroom would help the teacher to identify students 
who are undergoing mental distress and hence help them. This could reform the way in which 
student-teacher relationship pan out.
One prominent challenge we could face in this approach is when students try to fake their 
expressions. But studies have shown that, it is much easier to deduce emotions by observing the 
expressions of young children as compared to those of an adult. Hence the success rate of this 
approach would also be higher when applied to school children rather than adults.
